# Data Visualization & Insights  

## Overview  
This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and visualizing the cleaned and combined data extracted from H&M's website. The analysis includes:  
- **Univariate Analysis:** Examining the distribution of individual features.  
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Identifying relationships between two variables.  
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Exploring interactions among multiple features.  


## Dependencies  
Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the notebook:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Steps in the Notebook  
1. **Load and Explore Data**  
   - Import `Preprocessed_Data.csv`  

2. **Univariate Analysis**  
   - Visualizing the distribution of key features  

3. **Bivariate Analysis**  
   - Analyzing relationships 

4. **Multivariate Analysis**  
   - Identifying complex patterns  

## How to Use  
1. Open `Data_Visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run all cells sequentially to generate insights and plots.  
3. Analyze the visualizations for trends and patterns.  

## Notes  
- Ensure `Preprocessed_Data.csv` is available in the folder.
