H&amp;M Web Scraping &amp; Data Analysis Project 
📌 Overview In this project, we performed web scraping on the H&M website using Selenium to collect all available categories. After extracting the data, we will proceed with data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover key insights and trends.
Technologies Used
Python
Selenium (for web scraping)
Pandas (for data cleaning and manipulation)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
Data Collection
Extracted product categories from the H&M website.
Stored the scraped data in structured CSV/JSON format.
📊 Next Steps
✔️ Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns, distributions, and relationships in the data.
✔️ Visualization: Creating meaningful charts to represent trends and insights.
